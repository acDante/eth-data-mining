The transformation used is Random Fourier Features with Laplacian kernel. The omega_samples (sampled from the standard Cauchy distribution) and beta_samples (sampled from the uniform distribution on [0, 2*pi]) arrays are calculated and used for transforming the feature space of the input from 400 to 2000 dimensions. Afterwards an extra dimension is added with a value of one in order to integrate the bias into the weight vector when performing the training.
A mapper receives an array containing 5000 arrays corresponding to input training images. For each image the label and the features are split and the feature array is transformed using the transform function. Afterwards the ADAM method for stochastic optimization is performed for 80 epochs (each epoch includes all of the 5000 images in random order). The stochastic objective function used is the hinge loss function. We use the parameters proposed in the ADAM paper (alpha=0.001, beta1=0.9, beta2=0.999 and epsilon=10^(âˆ’8)). After 80 epochs the mapper emits the trained weight vector as the value, using 0 as the key since we want all of the weight vectors to be processed by the same reducer.
The reducer receives one key value pair, where the value is a list of trained weight vectors from all of the mappers. The reducer averages the weight vectors and outputs the averaged weight vector to be used for classification.
