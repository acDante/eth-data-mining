# ETH Data Mining: Learning from Large Data Sets course projects (Autumn 2016)
## Task 1: Locality sensitive hashing
In this project we find similar pairs of videos by implementing locality sensitive hashing on MapReduce.

## Task 2: Classification
In this project we perform classification of videos. The weight vector used for the ADAM classification is constructed in parallel using MapReduce. Random Fourier Features with Laplacian kernel are used to transform the data.

## Task 3: Clustering
In this project we perform clustering of images. We construct coresets of the dataset in perallel using MapReduce and perform k-means with multiple restarts on the union of the coresets.

## Task 4: Multi-armed bandits
In this projext we learn to recommend news articles to users by implementing the LinUCB algorithm.
